# Cache Config

Option `cache-config` will tell Sass Lint to cache the current configuration for each invocation of sass-lint. This option is disabled by default but you may consider enabling it if you're not planning on modifying your `.sass-lint.yml` config file as there will be a small performance gain.

## Options

* `true`/`false` (defaults to `false`)
